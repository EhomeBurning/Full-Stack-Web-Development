# Full Stack Web and Multiplatform Mobile App Development Specialization

Here are the in-class projects for *Full Stack Web and Multiplatform Mobile App Development Specialization* courses on Coursera.

> **Introduction:** The first two courses in this Specialization cover front-end frameworks: Bootstrap 4 and Angular. You’ll also learn to create hybrid mobile applications, using the Ionic framework, Cordova and NativeScript. On the server side, you’ll learn to implement NoSQL databases using MongoDB, work within a Node.js environment and Express framework, and communicate to the client side through a RESTful API. Learners enrolling in this Specialization are expected to have prior working knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.*

This specialization builds a series of websites for a fictional restaurant conFusion based on serveral different platforms and tools.

	./Ionic
	./json-server

This project built a hybrid app of *conFusion* based on **Ionic** and **Cordova**. This app is based on Ionic and Cordova. **Ionic** works as app framework. Then the **Ionic** app will be packaged by **Cordova**.

**Json-Server** works here as the server.

## 4. Multiplatform Mobile App Development with NativeScript ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/NodeJS-6.11.4-brightgreen.svg) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/AngularJS-4.3.0-red.svg) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/NativeScript-5.0.0-blue.svg)

	./NativeScript
	./json-server

This project built a hybrid app of *conFusion* based on **NativeScript**.

**Json-Server** works here as the server.

## 5. Server-side Development with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/NodeJS-6.11.4-brightgreen.svg) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/MangoDB-3.6.0-yellowgreen.svg) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/AngularJS-4.3.0-red.svg)

	./Angular/conFusion-Angular4-Firebase
	./Angular/conFusion-Angular4
	./MongoDB
	./NodeJS

This part includes the server side of the website.

**NodeJS** respondes all the requests from client side. **Express** is used here for **NodeJS** to operate on **MongoDB**.

**HTTPClient** of **Angular4** are utilized here to integrate the front-end with back-end.
